## NumberRush Activity ## 

A game of simple math to improve calculation speed of the player.

The can be run independently as a **.py** application or can be run on a **Sugar PC**.

The game requires the player to solve a simple mathematical question,simply by collecting the ball with the correct answer on it.

Four balls each with a different number drop from the top of the display and a mathematical problem will be prompted on the top *(Example : 1+2)*. The way the player scores by collecting the ball with the right answer on it *(here : 3)*, in the box.

The player is awarded 1 point for every correct answer and the game ends the moment a wrong ball is selected. 

The speed of the balls dropping increases as the game continues to make the higher points more and more challenging.
